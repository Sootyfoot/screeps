Resource collection

Peon (harvester/porter/upgrader) [WORK,CARRY,MOVE] Bootstrap mode (<=300)
Harvester [WORK,WORK,WORK,WORK,WORK,MOVE] (>=550)
Porter [CARRY,CARRY,MOVE] 0:2:1
Builder [WORK,CARRY,MOVE] 1:1:1
Upgrader [WORK,CARRY,MOVE] 1:1:1

Ratio of 1:1:1 is fatigue 0 on roads, but off roads, fatigue = x, where x = total WORK parts and non-empty CARRY parts

Maintain controller level
Perform critical repairs (<x% threshold)
Recover dropped resources & tombstone contents
Build essential structures (containers, extensions, towers, storage, spawns)
Build/dismantle other structures (roads, ramparts, walls, etc)
Upgrade & perform general repairs
